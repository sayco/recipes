INGREDIENTS
-2 lbs beef, prime rib is best
-1 cup plain yogurt
-1/4 cup vinegar
-2 cloves garlic, crushed
-1 teaspoon pepper
-1/2 teaspoon salt
-2 cardamom pods
-1 teaspoon allspice
-juice from 1 lemon
___________________________
FOR THE SAUCE:
-1 cup tahini
-2 cloves garlic, crushed
-1/4 cup lemon juice
-2 tablespoons yogurt
___________________________
PITA FILLINGS:
-8 loaves of pita bread or 4 large
-thinly sliced cucumbers
-thinly sliced onions
-1/2 teaspoon sumac
-thinly sliced tomatoes
-1/2 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped
-pickle slices (optional)

PREPARATION

Combine all ingredients except for beef, fillings, and sauce ingredients to make marinade. If it seems a little dry, add a little olive oil (a tablespoon at a time). Here is an excellent tahini recipe, if you do not have some handy.

Add beef, cover and refrigerate at least 8 hours, preferably overnight. 

In a stockpot or large saucepan, cook beef over medium heat for 45 minutes or until done. Be sure not to overcook! If beef becomes a little dry, add a few tablespoons of water throughout cooking duration.

While beef is cooking, prepare the sauce. Combine sauce ingredients and mix well. Set aside. 

Take the onions, tomatoes, cucumbers and sprinkle with sumac. Add other filling ingredients in a large bowl and combine well.

When the beef is done, you can shred it, slice it, or leave into large pieces. As long as it it thinly cut, there is not much difference. I prefer to cut mine into wide strips.
